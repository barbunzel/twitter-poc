# Twitter POC

This is my first MEAN Project *ever*. Maybe my first "serious" project ever. It was a requirement to join a project at my work place.

While I'm not particularly proud of the code since I'm a total noob, I am proud of the fact that I was able to do it mostly by myself, with help from documentation I found online. I must say, it wasn't easy. **At all.**

Anyway, here's all I did until the day I presented it. It's definitely not a finished product but it'll prove useful one day when I get better at JavaScript, best practices and using the MEAN stack.
